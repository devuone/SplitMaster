# SplitMaster
Check out Demo at : https://splitmaster-adeec.firebaseapp.com/groups

I created this app as a demo of my  Angular2 (typescript) skills.


SplitMaster will help you in spliting ot sharing group expenses easily.

Some demo data is already created for you, but you can create new or update data. 
Any chages done by you will not be saved and will remain available for that session only



Following concepts I learned/used
-Components communication through @Input, @Output params, Services and Observables.
-used Routing, child routes and route parameter
-integrated D3 chart library
-used bootstrap3 for app like responsive design.
-used NoSQL data concepts to interact with large JSON data structure.

Suggestions and queries are welcomed!
